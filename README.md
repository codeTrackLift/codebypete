Thanks for visiting my Portfolio Readme!

This website is intended to reflect my progression as a Web Developer as I make a career change.  I discovered freeCodeCamp.org in December of 2021 and fell in love with coding and started the self-teaching journey using freeCodeCamp.org and The Odin Project.

I also signed up for a Full Stack Coding Bootcamp with MIT xPro, where we will be learning to use MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.  This is a full-time 16 week program that runs from Feb-Jul, 2022.

Thank you again for visiting, I look forward to working with you during this exciting part of my journey!

Best Regards,
Pete
