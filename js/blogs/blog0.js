        <p>Hello!</p>
        <p>My name is Pete Chu and I have been a professional in the Pharmaceutical industry for the
            past 20
            years. My
            technical specialities include Facility Start-up, Equipment and System Validation, as well
            as
            Quality Engineering.
        </p>
        <p>I have a bachelor's degree in Biological Sciences from the University of Delaware. My
            experience
            includes
            Validation Consulting with Integrated Project Services (IPS), as well as direct employment
            with
            Janssen (formerly
            Centocor, Johnson & Johnson), and Eisai, Inc. (formerly Morphotek).</p>
        <p>With Janssen and Eisai, I was responsible for leading equipment and system qualification
            efforts
            as a Senior
            Validation Engineer. In 2012, I transitioned to a Senior Quality Engineer role within Eisai
            and
            was responsible
            for site metrics, quality dispositions, change controls, and leading investigations. In
            2017, I
            was managing the
            GMP Document Control and Quality Engineering teams.</p>
        <p>In December of 2021, I stumbled upon freeCodeCamp.org and rediscovered my childhood passion
            of
            coding and
            technology. I am currently at the midpoint of my career and have decided to part ways with
            Eisai
            in order to
            pursue a career change that is in line with a personal passion.</p>
        <p>I look forward to working with you on this exciting part of my journey!</p>
