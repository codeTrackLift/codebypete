                A month into the internship...
            </p>
            <p style='margin: 0.5rem auto;'>
                During a department meeting the topic of the User Interface Showcase came up.  All the members of the Frontend Engineering team were encouraged to make contributions, as well as recruit developers from other departments.
            </p>
            <p style='margin: 0.5rem auto;'>
                At this point, I had worked on about dozen tickets across three repositories, earned my 'Pull Shark' badge twice over, and was feeling really great about the intern experience overall!
            </p>
            <p style='margin: 0.5rem auto;'>
                However, when the Frontend Engineering Director at Forbes Media asks you to create something that will be 'showcased...' that CAN be rather intimidating. ðŸ˜…
            </p>
            <p style='margin: 0.5rem auto;'>
                Working on these tickets taught me a lot, but I also realized that I missed the creative aspects of developing my own projects.  To this point, I have relied on ScrollMagic, Bootstrap, and native CSS animations to make my projects responsive.
            </p>
            <p style='margin: 0.5rem auto;'>
                With my director's request, and an opportunity to contribute to the UI Showcase, I decided to try something new and learn some new libraries for React Animations.
            </p>
            <p style='margin: 0.5rem auto;' class='menloRegular cornflowerBlue'>
                What do I make?
            </p>
            <p style='margin: 0.5rem auto;'>
                My mind was an empty cup, which can work great for learning and a "student-mentality."  For creativity... Not so much.
            </p>
            <p style='margin: 0.5rem auto;'>
                So, I started by establishing an objective.  The "purpose" of my UI Experiment, would be to re-imagine an existing feature from Forbes.com, but use React Animations to add responsiveness.
            </p>
            <p style='margin: 0.5rem auto;'>
                I decided to target image carousels, and used my previous 'stock-ticker' project component as a starting point.
            </p>
            <p style='margin: 0.5rem auto;'>
                The first draft was functional, but not very impressive. It basically just rendered an array of images in a horizontal scrolling container, with some JavaScript to automate the scrolling.  That's when I started looking into different React Libraries.
