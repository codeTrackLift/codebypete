                A month into the internship...
            </p>
            <p style='margin: 0.5rem auto;'>
                During a department meeting the topic of the <span class='text-white'>UI Showcase</span> came up.  All the members of the Frontend Engineering team were encouraged to make <span class='text-white'>contributions</span>, as well as <span class='text-white'>recruit developers</span> from other departments.
            </p>
            <p style='margin: 0.5rem auto;'>
                At this point, I had worked on about dozen <a href='https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira' target='_blank'>Jira</a> tickets across multiple repositories, earned my '<a href='https://github.com/github-community/community/discussions/18248' target='_blank'>Pull Shark</a>' badge twice over, and was feeling really great about the intern experience overall.
            </p>
            <img src='../pics/blog/pullShark.gif' class='img-fluid mx-auto dropShadow' style='width:10rem' alt='Pull shark badge'>
            <p style='margin: 0.5rem auto;'>
                However, when the a Director at <a href='https://www.forbes.com/' target='_blank'>Forbes Media</a> asks you to create something that will be '<span class='text-white'>showcased</span>...' that <span class='text-white'>CAN</span> be rather intimidating. ðŸ˜…
            </p>
            <p style='margin: 0.5rem auto;'>
                Working on Jira tickets taught me a lot, but I also realized that I missed the creative aspects of developing my own projects.  To this point, I relied on <a href='https://scrollmagic.io/' target='_blank'>ScrollMagic</a>, <a href='https://getbootstrap.com/' target='_blank'>Bootstrap</a>, and native <a href='https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/animation' target='_blank'>CSS animations</a> to make my projects responsive.
            </p>
            <p style='margin: 0.5rem auto;'>
                With my director's request, and an opportunity to contribute to the UI Showcase, I decided to try something new and learn a different library for React Animations.
            </p>
            <p style='margin: 0.5rem auto;' class='menloRegular cornflowerBlue'>
                What do I make?
            </p>
            <p style='margin: 0.5rem auto;'>
                My mind was an empty cup, which can work great for learning and a "student-mentality."  For creativity... Not so much.
            </p>
            <p style='margin: 0.5rem auto;'>
                So, <span class='text-white'>I started by establishing an objective</span>.  The "<span class='text-white'>purpose</span>" of my UI Experiment, would be to re-imagine an existing feature from Forbes.com, but use React Animations to add responsiveness.
            </p>
            <p style='margin: 0.5rem auto;'>
                I decided to target image carousels, and used my previous '<a href='#blog8Button'>stock-ticker</a>' project component as a starting point.  The first draft was functional, but looked like a website from the early 2000's. ðŸ˜†
            </p>
            <p style='margin: 0.5rem auto;'>
                It basically just rendered an array of images in a horizontal scrolling container, and used some JavaScript to automate the scrolling.  That's when I started looking into different React Libraries.
            </p>
            <p style='margin: 0.5rem auto;'>
                <a href='https://www.framer.com/motion/' target='_blank'>Framer-Motion</a> -- this library is well supported, has many <a href='https://www.npmjs.com/package/framer-motion' target='_blank'>weekly downloads</a>, and was relatively simple to implement.  It's almost as easy as adding <code>motion.</code> to your JSX tags, then defining the desired effect as properties in the opening tag.
            </p>
            <p style='margin: 0.5rem auto;' class='menloRegular cornflowerBlue'>
                Contributing to the UI Showcase
            </p>
            <p style='margin: 0.5rem auto;'>
                This involving making a <span class='text-white'>pull request</span>, obtaining <span class='text-white'>reviewer approvals</span>, then ensuring the subsequent <span class='text-white'>build</span> and <span class='text-white'>deploy workflows</span> successfully completed. 
            </p>
            <p style='margin: 0.5rem auto;'>
                Next step was to <span class='text-white'>share my UI Experiment</span>.  Staring at the busy <a href='https://slack.com/' target='_blank'>Slack</a> channels, it was (again) <span class='text-white'>intimidating</span> to expose my beginner "mini-project" to a group of professionals.  The words, "<span class='text-white'>not worthy</span>" were sounding loudly in my head.
            </p>

            <p style='margin: 0.5rem auto;'>
                After making the post, I quickly switched off that Slack channel and decided to work on another ticket to pretend that it never happened. 
            </p>

                Regrets?
            </p>
            <p style='margin: 0.5rem auto;'>
                The whole experience ended up working out great.  <span class='text-white'>Met some new developers</span>, scheduled some 1:1s to learn about them and their departments.  Definitely <span class='text-white'>made some new connections</span>, maybe even made some new friends.
            </p>
            <p style='margin: 0.5rem auto;'>
                One of the developers gave me some really <span class='text-white'>great feedback</span> about <span class='text-white'>removing the "<span class='text-white'>filler text</span>," which was promptly implemented and produced an overall <span class='text-white'>cleaner presentation</span>.  Thank you for the feedback! ðŸ˜ƒ
            </p>
            <p style='margin: 0.5rem auto;'>
                I had always considered myself to be more on the analytical side.  Never thought of myself as someone who enjoyed creativity.  <span class='text-white'>Thank you Forbes</span> for making the <a href='https://www.linkedin.com/posts/codebypete_webdevelopment-mernstackdeveloper-activity-6931971649504198656-hdBr/?utm_source=linkedin_share&utm_medium=member_desktop_web' target='_blank'>opportunity</a> possible.
